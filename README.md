- 👋 Hi, I’m @meghanmcclain
- 👀 I’m interested in computer science and the stock market. I would like to expand my computer science skills and use github to document that.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C# and the .Net framework as well as Neural Networks. I would like to know more about machine learning.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything and everything. If I don't know something, I'm willing to Google and watch videos on YouTube until I know.
- 📫 How to reach me: email: meghan@meghanmcclain.com; website: https://meghanmcclain.com
